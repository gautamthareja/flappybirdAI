# flappybirdAI
Building the Flappy Bird game from scratch and implementing the NEAT genetic algorithm on it.

In this project, The original Flappy Bird game has been built along with some modifications.

The NEAT genetic algorithm has been applied to find a set of weights for which the bird does not die. 

Reinforcement learning has been used to reach to the optimal solution.

In the config file, the congiguration for the NEAT algorithm has been done by setting various parameters like the population number in each gen, the probability of mutation etc.
